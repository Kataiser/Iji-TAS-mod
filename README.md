# Iji TAS mod
Tool-Assisted Speedrun mod for Iji

Please note that Iji was made by Daniel Remar, and these redistributed game and source files are modified by me (https://github.com/Kataiser). You can find the game at http://remar.se/daniel/iji.php and the source code at http://remar.se/daniel/resources.php (in "Source codes and resources 1"). The iji_17_tas.gm81 file requires a registered Game Maker 8.1 to load and compile.
